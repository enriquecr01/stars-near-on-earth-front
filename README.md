# Stars Near Earth - Front End

## Project Objective
Stars Near Earth was made in order to put the Web Scraping technique into practice. The main table of [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars_and_brown_dwarfs) on Wikipedia is scraped and processed to give it a format and obtain the images of each star. 
This repository is related to the way of displaying the information returned by the scrap API.

Since Python hosting only has one core. You can select the type of process you want to use to display the information. Either load the saved stars or use the API and scrape.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
